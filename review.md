# Reviewer #1:
Yeah I didn't really read it, it looks ok but you should consider this and that.

# Reviewer #2:
There are significant methodological flaws and issues in your work, but that is ok because this is an exercise about learning and improving!
Please take a look at these three papers I had published, they are actually relevant to what you have done and I am surprised they are missing from your citations.
